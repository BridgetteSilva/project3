<div class="About-me">
	<p style="padding-left: 50rem; height: 60rem; padding-top: 18rem; width: 40rem">Jenifer Akagi and Maricell Cenidoza, co-owners of 77Salon Inc., are both Bay Area natives and started their careers in the beauty industry in 1993.  They opened their first salon in Oakland, California in 2008 and then another in nearby Alameda in 2013.  The salon and its work has been featured in numerous magazines, and has been honored with many awards over the years.  This women-owned business is proud to boast an amazing salon culture for both clients and employees alike.  There is a continuous stream of upcoming talent being trained year round as well as advanced and creative training for our experienced hairdressers. 

	This great community that has supported 77Salon since the beginning is one that they strive to give back to and return the favor.  Since opening, 77Salon has donated to many local schools, non-profit organizations, volunteered at community kitchens, food banks and foster homes, and continues to be an advocate of people doing good things for the Bay Area!  P.S. shop SMALL, shop LOCAL!</p>
